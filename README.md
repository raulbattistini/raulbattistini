- Hi, I’m @raulbattistini, currently at the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo - SP, Brazil. I am 19 years by 2022.

- I’m interested in both front and backend developing: Vuejs and vanilla Javascript; Python, SQL database and C language, respectively.

- I’m currently learning JS Frameworks (currently in the "V" of the MEVN stack). There's a long journey for me to take till being able to call myself a full-stack developer: NodeJS, MongoDB database and Express.js.

- You can reach me on LinkedIn: /raul-battistini 
By now, I know HTML of course, some vanilla CSS and also a bit of Bootstrap. I have made some web-design projects with Wordpress and GIMP such as https://residencialecomercialgamaro.com (for real estate in Sao Paulo). 
Besides developing, I know quite a bit of marketing as well, with some knowledge in copywriting and advertising.
